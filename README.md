## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
    - Node Version 23.11.0.
- Java JDK installed.
    - JDK Version 23.
- MySQL database running locally.
- Docker (optional, for running MySQL via Docker Compose).

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `api` folder.
2. Configure the database connection in `application.properties` on `\src\main\resources\` folder.

    üîê **About app.key and app.key.pub**  
    This project uses asymmetric RSA encryption to sign and verify authentication tokens via OAuth2/JWT.

    - `app.key` ‚Üí Private key used to sign JWT tokens.  
    - `app.key.pub` ‚Üí Public key used to verify JWT tokens.  

    These keys are included in the repository only to simplify local setup and testing.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**:  
    These keys are not intended for production use.  
    If you plan to deploy this project in a real environment, you must generate your own RSA key pair and replace the included files to ensure security.
